* SVM-GRID

  Grid search for libsvm.


  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    bash svm-grid.sh > svm-grid.out
    sort -g -k1,2 svm-grid.out | awk -f group.awk > rates.dat
    gnuplot -c contour.gp rates.dat BESTC BESTG
  #+END_SRC

  Note: This isn't fully automatic yet. You also need to change the
  svm-grid.sh file to take your datafiles, etc. You need to provide
  best c and gamma. Planning to integrate the gnuplot stuff with
  svm-grid better.

  There is also a plan to make the whole script configurable in the
  same way as libsvms grid.py, but I haven't gotten that far yet.
