* SVM-GRID

  Grid search for libsvm.

  Requires
    - GNU Parallel (https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)
    - pv (https://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml)


  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    bash svm-grid.sh > svm-grid.out
    sort -g -k1,2 svm-grid.out | awk -f group.awk > rates.dat
    gnuplot -c contour.gp rates.dat BESTC BESTG
  #+END_SRC



  There is also a plan to make the whole script configurable in the
  same way as libsvms grid.py, but I haven't gotten that far yet.
